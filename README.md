# Fluent New Tab

A New Tab page designed following Microsoft's Fluent Design, with Reveal Effects and more.

Meant as a replacement for the default "New Tab" experience in Microsoft Edge, for all the Windows 10/Fluent Design afiocionados out there üé®

## Configuration

Configuration is currently handled through a CLI interface. To use it, open the DevTools and enter one of the following commands in the Tab "Console", then confirm by pressing Enter:

### `backgroundImage.choose()`:

Open a file picker, there you can select a custom image to be used as the background. Mustn't be larger than 2MB.

### `backgroundImage.reset()`:

Delete your custom image and use the default background image again.

### `siteConfig.addSite()`:

Add a new thumbnail for a given URL, which you can insert between the two parentheses. Needs to be quoted and a full valid URL including the protocol.  
E.g. `siteConfig.addSite("https://jonaskuske.com")` üåê

### `siteConfig.removeSiteAtPosition()`:

Remove the site(s) at the given position(s), which you can insert between the parentheses, separated by commas.  
E.g. `siteConfig.removeSiteAtPosition(1)` will delete the first thumbnail and `siteConfig.removeSiteAtPosition(2,5,8)` will delete the 2nd, 5th and 8th site.

### `siteConfig.reset()`:

Undo thumbnail customizations and use the 8 default sites.

**A more robust configuration with an actual UI will follow once I have the time for it.**

### `_reset()`:
