# Fluent New Tab  
A New Tab page designed following Microsoft's Fluent Design, with Reveal Effects and more.  

Meant as a replacement for the default "New Tab" experience in Microsoft Edge, for all the Windows 10/Fluent Design afiocionados out there ðŸŽ¨
  
## Configuration

For configuration, [edit the inline script in `index.html`](https://github.com/jonaskuske/fluent-tab/blob/master/index.html#L12-L22). This is (hopefully) just a temporary solution, a settings interface will follow.
